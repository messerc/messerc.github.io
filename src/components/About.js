          I grew up in Massachusetts and moved out to San Francisco in 2017.
          Currently, I love using javascript and the tools / frameworks built by
          the community to create great experiences. In my former life, I was a
          psuedo-professional online gamer (I signed a contract that was
          e-mailed to me in a pdf, so it was pretty serious). If you'd like to
          chat, send me an <a href="mailto:messer.chr@gmail.com">e-mail</a>
